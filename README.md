# ForecastAI – Human Behaviour

This repository contains a reproducible Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and modeling human behavior patterns using machine learning.  
The analysis is based on a public dataset distinguishing extrovert and introvert behavioral characteristics.

## Objective
- Apply machine learning methods to behavioral data
- Perform binary classification (extrovert vs. introvert)
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
